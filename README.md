# Task manager
 Study project for creating a Rest API with nodeJS, Axios, Express, MongoDB and mangoose.
 
 I followed the great tutorial by John Smilga (https://www.johnsmilga.com/).
 The code for the front end was supllied at John's github (https://github.com/john-smilga/node-express-course).
 
 The structure of the application is as follows:
 
 Front-end requests to create, edit and delete a task are sent via axios to the back-end.
 The back end consists of the following structure: the app.js (base application), routes, models, controllers, middlewares and an error handler.
